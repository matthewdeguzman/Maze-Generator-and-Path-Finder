# Maze Generator and Path Finder

[Roblox experience](https://www.roblox.com/games/7238923668/Maze-Generater-and-Path-Finder) where mazes of random sizes can be generated with a depth-first search. The user can compare Dijkstra's algorithm and the breadth-first search algorithm in terms of speed for finding the shortest path between two points in the maze.
